                  这门课程牵涉到最优化理论，运动规划还有机器学习。。。

                   These notes also reflect a deep belief in computational algorithms playing an essential role in finding and optimizing solutions to complex dynamics and control problems. Algorithms play an increasingly central role in modern control theory; these days even rigorous mathematicians consider finding convexity in a problem (therefore making it amenable to an efficient computational solution) almost tantamount to an analytical result. Therefore, the notes necessarily also cover selected material from optimization theory, motion planning, and machine learning.

                   is that having some comfort with linear algebra. I'm going to be throwing around--

                  <div>
                   I'll do a little bit in this lecture, partly to give you a taste.

                  <div>
                   We're gonna be throwing around matrix equations a lot.

                   Taking inverses of matrices, multiplying matrices, things like that.

                  <div>
                   These are things that, if you're comfortable with, it'll be a lot easier.

                   Basic differential equations -- you don't have to be able to solve differential equations in your head.

                  <div>
                   is something we're gonna use a lot.

                 <div>
                  So you're in underactuated robotics.
                 </div>
                 <div>
                  My goal for today is to give you some of the background
                  <span>
                   and motivation, try to convince you that robots moving fast
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   is cool.
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   It's fun.
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   It's just -- it's everything you'd
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   want in a research problem.
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   Hopefully it's everything you'd want in a course.
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   And even -- I'm hoping to convince you
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   that

                  <span>
                   even if you don't ever intend to build a walking

                  <span>
                   robot or a robot that throws things

                  <span>
                   or skids across a parking lot,
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   you should probably still care about dynamics.

                 <div>
                  Because it gives you a very rich way to think about perception,
                  <span>
                   maybe, about a lot of different problems in robotics.

                 <div>

                  <span>
                   But we're gonna talk about a lot throughout the term
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   about different underactuated systems.

                 </div>
                 <div>
                  Walking systems, running systems, swimming, flying,

                   manipulation.

                  My second goal for the course is to make
                  <span>
                   sure you understand the title of the course.
                  </span>
                  <span>
                   What it means to be underactuated.
                  </span>

                    <div>
                     Hopefully by halfway through the lecture,
                     <span>
                      you'll have a pretty good formal sense of what that means.

                     A minor note -- so it's fully hyphen --

                    <div>
                     I chose to take the hyphen out because I feel like,
                     <span>
                      if we're gonna name the course that, we can say underactuated
                     </span>
                     <span>
                      is a word in and of itself.
                     </span>
                     <span>
                      So it's not a mistake.

                     <span>
                      I chose consciously to leave the hyphen out
                     </span>
                     <span>
                      and say we've got a new word coined.

                   <div>
                    We're gonna talk about a few technical ideas.
                    <span>
                     We're gonna cover the idea of feedback linearization.
                    </span>

                   <div>
                    Try to convince you that it's extremely powerful.
                    <span>
                     And then try to convince you to never do it.
                    </span>
                   </div>
                   <div>
                    Or at least to do it only if you're willing to have a weight on your conscience.
                   </div>
                   <div>
                    And then I'm gonna tell you about some of the structure -- that's fine for me, if that's better for you.
                   </div>
                   <div>
                    I don't want people to fall asleep. But if that makes things pop. That was you?
                   </div>
                   <div>
                    Oh, it was an accident. Oh. I thought it was an opinion.
                    <span style="font-size:12px">

                   <br/>
                   So we're gonna talk about some of the features of the dynamics we'll talk about, some of the structure you'll see in the manipulator equations. And then I'm gonna try to do sort of a quick overview of what you're gonna see for the rest of the term, the plan for the term.
                  </div>
                  <div>
                   And we'll end with a couple of logistics just to make sure I've said them.
                   <br/>
                   <span>
                    Here we go. So let's talk about some of the background and motivation.

                 <div>
                  <div>
                   So maybe I'll start by telling you how I got into the problem.

                     called the Leg Laboratory that was hidden

                    <span>
                     is he had this huge ceilings, about like this room.

                    <span>
                     And from these ceilings hung all kinds of famous robots.

                    <span>
                     They were just -- you'd look up and you'd

                    <span>
                     see robots that maybe never worked,

                     robots that looked they would have been a cool idea.

                    <span>
                     And then they've got some really, really famous robots.

                    <span>

                    <span>
                     He started building robots that were hopping around on one leg,
                    </span>
                   </div>
                   <div>
                    like a pogo stick, convinced that that was a good way
                    <span>
                     to think about running.

                   <div>
                    And we'll talk a lot about that assumption.
                    <span>
                     We'll have a lecture on the dynamics and control
                    </span>
                    <span>
                     of running robots later in the term.

                   <div>
                    But this sort of menagerie of fantastically dynamic robots

                     that started coming out of this lab between 1980 and 1984,

                   <div>
                    at a time where most robots in the world
                    <span>
                     were moving extremely slowly this

                    <span>
                     was just a huge shock to the system.

                   <div>
                    It could do flips, right.

                     has always been about dynamics, about things that fly around

                     and not moving slowly and conservatively.

                    <div>
                     They even went on -- they built a quadruped back then.

                    <div>
                     Actually, I was there.

                      It wasn't long after I showed up as a grad student,

                    <div>

                    <div>
                     He pointed to the treadmill off to the side.
                     <span>
                      He says, you guys using that?

                    <div>

                       But back in 1997, when they first showed the world
                       <span>
                        that they'd been doing this, this was

                       <span>
                        -- this was huge.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Nobody knew that a robot like this could exist.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Especially-- I mean, walking around on flat ground
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       was something that other robots were capable of,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       but not quite so much like this.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But the fact that there was this whole humanoid capable of doing
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       other things-- like, there's gonna
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       be examples in here of it doing some basic manipulation.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Of it pushing a cart.
                       <span>
                        Of it climbing stairs.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Right?
                       <span>
                        This is the cart-pushing.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And this was the one that I remember
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       people were just constantly talking about.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This was at a time when the Leg Lab
                       <span>
                        was thinking a lot about how to take the dynamics --
                        <br/>
                        the success
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        of the dynamic hopping robots and trying
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        to build walking robots in the same spirit.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And it was -- it was a hard go.
                       <span>
                        And in fact I'd say we're still, today,
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        trying to finish that story.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Now, when you watch this, I want the first thing
                       <span>
                        you think to be, wow, that's amazing.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This robot's walking around.
                       <span>
                        You could ask what would happen if we started it a little bit
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        different place on the stairs.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And if you look hard enough on YouTube
                       <span>
                        you'll find out what happens.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But still, this was just absolutely far
                       <span>
                        beyond what anybody was doing at the time in terms
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of walking robots that could move around
                       <span>
                        and possibly do practical work in the world.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But the other thing you should think about when you see that
                       <span>
                        is that it's not all that dynamic.
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        Right?
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <span>
                        <span>
                        </span>
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So it is a dynamic robot.
                       <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">
                        It is only balanced based on its momentum.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And we'll talk more about what that means.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But it doesn't -- it doesn't really appeal to the eye.

                      <div>
                       It uses about 20 times more energy,

                        scaled, than a human when we walk,

                      <div>

                        the total work done on the mechanical system, moving it.

                        that people were talking about as the opposing

                      <div>
                       story to this Honda humanoid story that was emerging
                       <span>
                        was sort of the opposite extreme --

                      </div>
                      <div>
                       the opposite side of the spectrum --
                       <span>
                        were these passive dynamic walkers.

                      <div>
                       So this is almost not a robot at all.
                       <span>
                        This is a bunch of ball bearings and sticks and hinges

                      <div>
                       and curved feet.
                       <span>
                        But if you put it on top of a small ramp

                       <span>
                        and you give it a push it walks ... BEAUTIFULLY.

                      <div>
                       Right?

                      <div>
                       It just falls, powered only by gravity,
                       <span>
                        wanders its way down a ramp.

                      <div>
                       And it looks like someone taking a stroll through the park.

                      <div>
                       Right?

                      <div>
                       It's really just a beautiful example,
                       <span>
                        a beautiful demonstration that the dynamics, the physics
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of walking, really capture a lot of the problem, right?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       They really -- if we could somehow
                       <span>
                        harness natural-- the natural dynamics of our machines

                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and build our machines with the weight distributed
                       <span>
                        in the right way, then we should be

                      <div>
                       able to make very efficient machines.

                      <div>
                       Maybe that's a reason why I'm relatively

                       They're coming down at a very conservative approach.
                       <span>
                        So this is a really low angle of attack,
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        entry towards the carrier.

                       <span>
                        And the reason they do that is because

                       <span>
                        in this sort of dynamic regime this

                       <span>
                        is the conservative place in the spectrum.

                      <div>
                       Where you have a lot of control authority, where actually
                       <span>
                        our models of dynamics work well, and our feedback design
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        works well.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Birds are a bit more like the passive walker.
                       <span>
                        Birds are throwing caution to the wind.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       When they go to land on a perch they flare their winds up
                       <span>
                        to a huge angle of attack.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                       We've argued that maybe this is actually --
                       <span>
                        because he's coming down -- a lot of birds actually come
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        down at greater than 90 degrees angle of attack.

                       <span>
                        So let me just say what angle of attack
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        means, just to make sure I'm clear about it.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                       But I forgot to change this image.
                       <span>
                        An air coil at a low angle of attack, the air just sort
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        of nicely goes around the air coil.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This one's supposed to be like this.
                       <span>
                        At a slightly moderate angle of attack
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        you'll see that the air still goes nicely around the wing
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and all is well.
                       <span>
                        We can use any sort of low angle of attack regimes.

                       <span>
                        Piecewise linear models of the fluid dynamics
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        work really well.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And then high gain feedback control
                       <span>
                        works very well to stabilize these.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       If this were hypothetically a picture like this,
                       <span>
                        then what you'll see is that when
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       you go to a high angle of attack everything changes
                       <span>
                        about the dynamics.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       The air no longer can stay attached to the wing
                       <span>
                        as it bends around the wing.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       You can see the air doesn't quite make it there.
                       <span>
                        You get a detached flow off the back of the wing.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                       Separation -- you get nonlinear dynamics.
                       <span>
                        Some complicated post-stall aerodynamics.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And somehow this has been a hard thing for us
                       <span>
                        to control with high gain feedback control.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So the birds are doing just like the passive walkers,
                       <span>
                        where they're going into this more complex dynamic regime
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        to do it.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And they're getting a huge dynamic benefit for doing it.
                       <span>
                        They can actually take much more dynamic approaches to perches.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       They land pretty darn well in very short areas.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>

                      <div>
                       So this is actually a theme that we'll
                       <span>
                        hit again and again in different disciplines,

                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that there's a conservative approach where

                      <div>
                       you can use feedback to sort of cancel out

                       the natural dynamics of your machine.

                      <div>
                       And that's what we're gonna talk about

                      <div>
                       with the feedback linearization.

                      <div>
                       And just overpower physics.

                      <div>
                       But you shouldn't.

                       kind of robotics, you should let the dynamics rule.

                      <div>
                       And just push and pull the dynamics

                      <div>
                       a little bit to make it do what you want the system to do.

                      <div>
                       And that's really what the course is about.

                      <div>
                       It's sort of a fundamental course

                      <div>
                       about understanding dynamics.

                      <div>
                       We're gonna take a very computational approach

                      <div>
                       to solving the problem.

                      <div>

                      <div>
                       they're landing on a perch.

                      <div>
                       you might have noticed here, while you're watching,

                      <div>
                       is that there's separation happening at the leading edge.

                      <div>
                       And you can see it in the feathers.

                      <div>
                       So there's complicated aerodynamics

                      <div>
                       that are pulling those feathers up and away that you wouldn't

                      <div>
                       And actually the whole wing is almost certainly

                      <div>
                       separated in that final phase of flight.

                      <div>

                       we've had in the lab for the last couple years.

                      <div>
                       We've been working on making airplanes
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that could land on a perch like a bird.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Turns out fixed-wing aircraft-- there's
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       no problem with our mechanical design.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       You can take a fixed-wing aircraft-- we shoot it out
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of a crossbow in a motion capture arena for this video.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And you can make them land on a perch just like a bird.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       You just have to be willing to think
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       about the post-stall aerodynamics
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and think about the potentially nonlinear control
                       <span>
                        to make that happen.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So it's not a class about mimicking biology, necessarily.

                      <div>
                       But biology has lots and lots of examples where they're just
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       cleaning our clocks in terms of the control systems they have.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Very, very simple control systems, possibly in biology,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       doing phenomenally complex things
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       by all of our engineering metrics.

                      <div>
                       This one was originally done in a motion capture arena.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But to convince you that the fluid dynamics are complicated
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       we built a small wind tunnel, released some smoke
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       from the leading edge.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And you can see the post stall aerodynamics of the wing
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       there with the smoke visualization.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And that's not a one-off demonstration.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       By the time Joe was finished with his thesis he could just
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       throw this airplane and it would always land on the perch.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       All kinds of initial conditions.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       He had a version that could land on a power line using no motion
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       capture, just using the magnetic field of the power line
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       to localize the perch.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       He had a magnetometer on the plane.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Just used the magnetic field of the power line
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       to find where the perch was.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Just do the same thing.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It actually worked a little bit better than this one
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       because there was less delay in the feedbacks.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And then by the end he was taking it outside
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and trying to land even on a windy day.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And the results were actually spectacular.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So most of the time you could estimate the wind
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       in the first moments of flight, assume
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that the wind wasn't going to change,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and hit the perch perfectly.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But he's got a couple great videos where it comes along
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and the wind just blows it-- whoosh-- the airplane just has
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       no control authority and just disappears
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       from the camera just like that.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It doesn't even have a propeller.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I forgot to say, this is a glider.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I love this is kind of project, where you're really letting--
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       you're willing to go into these complicated dynamic regimes
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and let reasoning about those dynamics sort of get you
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       a performance that you couldn't get before.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       There's lots of other examples just in the flight world.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I put a few more of them in the course notes,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       about roll rates of different birds and the like.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Some of my favorite examples are the albatross.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I mean, the albatross can fly for days, powered basically
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       only by the wind.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So these guys can fly across the ocean with the same total cost
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of transport a 747, which is sort of cool.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It's hard to compare the scalings
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of these very different things.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Their cost of transport is about the same.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But what's really cool is if you take
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       the metabolic rate, the average metabolic rate of this guy
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       as he flies across the ocean, and you compare it
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       to what his metabolic rate is when he's sitting on the beach,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       it's basically indistinguishable.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Their metabolism working just as hard
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       when they're sitting on the beach
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       as when they're flying across the ocean.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And how is that?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Well, I guess they could be very inefficient on the beach.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       That's possible.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But they don't spend that much time there.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So I have to put that caveat in.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But probably they're extremely efficient in the air, right?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Because all they're basically doing is minor directions.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So they can exploit the shear layer over the ocean.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So the wind's almost always blowing over the ocean.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       One of the great things about that
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       is that means that if you're just blowing wind
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       across the surface there's friction at the bottom.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So it's gonna slow down the wind and there's
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       gonna be a velocity profile as you
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       go up away from the surface.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So the wind's blowing faster away from the surface
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and slow at the surface.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       These guys exploit that gradient and they fly circles,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       even upwind if they need to.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       They fly in circles in order to do dynamic soaring
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and fly forever, basically, just powered by the wind.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Even up into the wind.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Falcons have been reported diving-- well,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       people say 250 miles an hour.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       The only science paper I've seen said 180 miles per hour.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And the speed that they dive isn't really that-- I mean,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       it's impressive.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But I guess a bullet goes very fast too.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       What's really cool is when they can
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       take their 180 mile per hour dive
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and then suddenly pull out of it and grab a pigeon
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       or whatever the unlucky fellow is that day.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       They're doing incredibly dynamic things
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       when they're in this bullet-like trajectory,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       diving down into a city or something like that.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So nature's just cleaning our clocks.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This is another example I saw when I visiting Berkley
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       last year.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It's a hummingbird with his nose in a feeder.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       That's pretty cool.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Let me play it again.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So these guys are able to maintain
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       flight with extraordinary precision on their beaks
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       here, so they can feed.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       That's what they have to do, even in nature.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But what's really cool-- you see this little arrow,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       this air flow arrow.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       That video-- until I tell you, I think
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       you wouldn't have guessed.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       When he's flying like that, with his beak perfectly in,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       he's actually flying backwards at 3 meters per second.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       OK?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So they decided to put a wind in, coming to behind.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And he's actually doing a backstroke
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       at 3 meters per second.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       They could turn it up to about 4.5 meters
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       per second in that paper.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I think I heard them say that they did 7 meters per second.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But the paper only says 4.5.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And they're doing the backstroke and basically
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       keeping their nose right spot on where
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       it needs to be in order to feed from the feeder.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       That's amazing.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       In fact their metabolic rate is indistinguishable, again,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       from -3.3 meters per second to positive 3
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       meters per second in the flow.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Their stroke is quite kinematically different,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       but they're basically effortless in doing this.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       All right.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And one last example, which is my favorite one ever.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So it's from the underwater world.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This is my work from George Lauder and Mike Triantafyllou.

                       So they, a number of years ago, studied the rainbow trout.

                      <div>
                       that swim upstream at mating season.

                      <div>
                       So this is a rainbow trout in a water tunnel.

                      <div>
                       Viewed down from above, so it's the silhouette.

                      <div>
                       like when it's sort of swimming nominally.

                      <div>
                       That's the nominal sort of steady state gait

                      <div>
                       of a rainbow trout in a water tunnel.

                      <div>
                       Now, the reason they're an interesting animal to study
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       is because the rainbow trout are the ones that
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       swim upstream at mating season, right?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And if you watch them swim upstream at mating season
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       they often do things like hang out behind rocks.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So if you take a rock in a stream,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       just like the vortex street behind the wing,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       a rock in a stream is gonna leave a vortex wake.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       There's gonna be a wake behind this stream.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And you ask, what would happen if I take this fish in the lab
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and put it behind a synthetic rock and into a vortex street?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       The hypothesis is it's gonna change the way it swims.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And in fact it changes its gait dramatically.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This is what they called the von Hermann gait of the fish.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So it's somehow doing something dynamically clever, it seems,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       to sort of swim between the vortices.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And the question was, are they getting some dynamic benefit
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       from that?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Probably-- they look like they're resting there.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Maybe they're doing something very clever with it.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Well, the video that's the clincher,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       for me, at least, is-- I've just realized
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       why the videos are playing kind of funny.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This is another fish.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Here's another-- this fish is dead, OK?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It's being held on by a string so it doesn't
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       go back and get caught in the grate.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It starts getting knocked around by the vortex street.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       That's sort of expected, maybe.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       The thing that is highly unexpected, if you ask me,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       is that that dead fish, after getting knocked
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       around a little bit, starts swimming upstream.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So the water's going this way, just to be absolutely clear.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       There's a vortex wake coming off the back
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of this body that's knocking the fish around.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And the fish just passively swam upstream.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So it's not even necessarily a control system doing the work.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       In this case there's no control system.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It's dead.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       The mechanical design of the fish
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       was enough to make this sort of a dynamically
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       beautiful creature.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So there's tons and tons and tons
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of great examples from biology.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We'll talk about some of them in more depth sort of later
                       <span>
                        in the class.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>

                       </span>

                      <div>
                       And then these days my group and some
                       <span>
                        of
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        -- a group of people here at MIT are working on this DARPA challenge.
                       </span>
                       <br/>

                      <div>
                       So you'll see that the dynamics story that we're telling here
                       <span>
                        is going to play out also in our very complicated robots.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This is the Atlas robot, built by Boston Dynamics
                       <span>
                        but programmed here at MIT, with the MIT beaver on its back.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And it was tasked, in last December,
                       <span>
                        to go into these Hollywood-like sets
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and do some complicated -- we had one chance to do
                       <span>
                        pretty complicated tasks.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And we'll do it again next June, hopefully much
                       <span>
                        more complicated tasks.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We'll talk more about Atlas later in the term.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But just to say that we will work up
                       <span>
                        to the complexity of these sorts of types
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        of robots in the class.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And you'll see that they're actually --
                       <span>
                        they're computationally more challenging.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But the ideas that are gonna power the robots like Atlas
                       <span>
                        are gonna be as simple as some of the ideas we
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       see on very simple robots, that we'll
                       <span>
                        be able to write the equations down for.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So this is the robot's view of itself.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This is the camera view.
                       <span>
                        And it's just doing some simple tasks.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Turning valves in that video.
                       <span>
                        But we'll show you more advanced tasks later.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We have high hopes for Atlas being very dynamic very soon.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       [INAUDIBLE] -- they're gonna make this happen pretty soon,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I think.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                       I thought Lawson
                       <span style="font-size:12px">
                        [who?]
                       </span>
                       was gonna be here.
                       <span>
                        I thought I saw him come in.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So I stole a slide from Lawson's paper here,
                       <span>
                        just to try to make the point that I think

                      </div>
                      <div>
                       all this dynamic stuff matters even if you care
                       <span>
                        about perception or manipulation or other robotics-like tasks.

                      <div>
                       So to very quickly summarize Lawson's paper
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       on collision-free state estimation,
                       <span>
                        he observed that there was this annoying problem

                      <div>

                      <div>
                       often told me that the most likely state of these objects

                      <div>
                       was something like this, which is clearly not -- it's clearly

                      <div>
                       violating some basic assumptions of non-penetration.

                       Because clearly there's some basic notions
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       of static stability and static mechanics that would give me

                      <div>
                       very, very strong priors on my observations of the world.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And I hope that we'll be able to get to problems like that
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       where, even if you don't care about making robots
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       move, but you just care about understanding the world--
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that, really, this stuff's going to play out there, too.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       If you care about UAVs, this is just a quad-rotor.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We'll be making things like this happen in your problem sets.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       This is just a quad-rotor darting through trees.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       If you care about quadrotors, hopefully we'll
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       have some exciting things for you.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And if you care about other robots,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       multi-legged-- you name it.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We're gonna be able to hit a couple-- there are dynamics
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that rule in a lot of these different robotic domains.
                      </div>

                       <br/>

                      <div>
                       That was our motivation.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Hopefully it's an exciting idea.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I mean, really, I think, we're gonna cover walking UAVs,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       manipulation.

                      <div>
                       There's another one I didn't say.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But the way uncertainty propagates
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       through dynamical systems, it actually
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       is a very under-actuated kind of process.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We'll think about that.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       If you care about Thomas Carr's boats-- you name it.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We'll be able to-- we'll hopefully
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       have something for you.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       It really has everything that I wanted in a research topic.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       There's really beautiful underlying mathematics
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       in most of these problems.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       There's beautiful physical experiments that you can do.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I mean, the water-- the fluid dynamics
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       is sort of the best example.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We've had things as simple as a soap bubble-- a falling soap
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       bubble.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       You put a pin through it and you get a beautiful vortex
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       street coming out.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       There's just beautiful fundamental physics
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that you can end up playing with to understand
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       what we're talking about here.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But there's also hardcore algorithms and cool hardware
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       demos.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And I think it might hold the key to some really important
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       problems, like clean energy or understanding the brain.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We'll see.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So here's the basic plan.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So I'm gonna see if I can start effectively
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       using this as the board, here.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Wow.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I didn't write that.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       That's cool.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Yeah, that's better.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So here's what you'll learn.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So we're gonna try to review what people know
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       about the canonical systems in each of the domains
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that I talked about.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So there are basic concepts in a lot of these domains
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       that I think-- I hope by putting a broader view on them they'll
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       really snap together pretty nicely.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So the basic-- there's a few basic principles
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       about how your center of mass moves,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and the like, from walking, let's say.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Some basic concepts from manipulation.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       From state estimation, from flying machines and the like.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Each time we go into one of those areas
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I'll try to tell you a bit about the leading
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       examples from those areas.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And some of the insights that people
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       have had-- the domain-specific insights into those areas.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But we're also-- we're gonna chart our course
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       through those different areas in a very specific way
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       to try to build up our algorithms.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Every time we introduce a new system,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       like our walking system or a new manipulation system,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       we're gonna examine what the best algorithms we've
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       talked about so far can do in that domain.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And how maybe we can extend it with some of the insights
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       from that domain.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So we can have relatively general--
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       really a a general toolkit for reasoning about dynamics.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And that's gonna mean you're gonna write some code yourself.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We're gonna try to force you to write some

                      <div>
                       of the core algorithms for each of these different domains.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We're also gonna give you, in cases,

                      <div>
                       some of our implementations of the algorithms.

                      <div>
                       So you can do more advanced things
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       and get to the complicated examples quickly.

                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And what do you need to do-- a lot of people ask me,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       what about the prereqs for the course?
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       When we first introduced the course
                       <span>
                        I listed the undergraduate robotics courses
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        in the institute as prerequisites.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Or I said, or robotics experience,
                       <span>
                        or something like that.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I've actually backed off on that.
                       <br/>
                       <span>
                        So you actually don't need to understand robot kinematics.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I mean, it'll be great if you do.
                       <span>
                        You don't really have to understand --
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       you don't have to be able to write down
                       <span>
                        the Lagrangian of a mechanical system.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We're gonna mostly give those to you.
                       <span>
                        And the kinematics and dynamics of the robot
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        are sort of something that the software
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        can give us pretty quickly.
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        You don't have to think about that yourself.
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        So we're not really assuming anything
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        about your robotics background.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We're gonna have a couple lectures which
                       <span>
                        will introduce dynamics hopefully
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        in an interesting enough way that the dynamic system
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        in the audience won't be bored but will bring us
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        all on the same page on the basic concepts from dynamics.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And we're not really making deep assumptions there.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <br/>
                       But what you do need, I think, from past experience,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       is that having some comfort with linear algebra.
                       <span>
                        I'm going to be throwing around--
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I'll do a little bit in this lecture,
                       <span>
                        partly to give you a taste.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We're gonna be throwing around matrix equations a lot.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Taking inverses of matrices, multiplying matrices,
                       <span>
                        things like that.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       These are things that, if you're comfortable with,
                       <span>
                        it'll be a lot easier.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Basic differential equations -- you
                       <span>
                        don't have to be able to solve differential
                       </span>
                       <span>
                        equations in your head.
                       </span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I can't, most of the ones we write down in this course.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       Some of that don't have closed-form solutions. [hhhh]
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But you should understand what they mean.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And we'll talk more about dynamic or dynamical systems.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       We'll give you some very basic simple dynamical systems
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       to think about.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       But the idea of having a differential equation
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       is something we're gonna use a lot.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And, not a prerequisite, but we're
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       gonna do problem sets in MATLAB.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       So you'll have to have MATLAB installed, at least.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       And if you're a MATLAB whiz then you're gonna like the course,
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       I think.
                      </div>
                     </span>
                    </div>
                   </div>
                   <br/>
                   <span>
                    <div>
                     All right, so let's do some definitions. I think it's high time you understand the title of the course, right?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     The other thing I like about it, is
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     I get to face this way, instead of you seeing
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     the back of my head the whole time.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     All right, so we're going to be talking about differential
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     equations in the course, non-linear differential
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     equations in general, right?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So our basic building block is going
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     to be a differential equation that
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     looks something like this, a control differential equation,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     OK?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So x dot equals f of xu, all right?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So let's just break this guy down, just
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     make sure we're all on the same page.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     x is what we're going to call the state vector of the system.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So that could be, let's say, the position of my elbow,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     the position of my wrist, on a robotic arm.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     The velocity of my elbow, the velocity of my wrist, OK?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     u is going to be my control input.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So maybe it's the torque at the elbow from a motor
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     and at the wrist.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     These are going to be vectors, right?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     That means f is potentially a vector value function.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     And then x dot is the time derivative of x.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So what this function tells me is
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     how x evolves in time given where I am right now
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     and what control I'm applying.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So x dot, we just defined it as dx dt, the time derivative
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     of the state vector.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So like I said, the only thing I don't like about this
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     is that this is going to go away in a second, when
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     I want to write more.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     We're actually recording it, so we'll put them up.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     The lecture notes have all these equations too.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So in particular, we're going to look at particular forms of f
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     that we care a lot about.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So in particular, we're going to focus on mechanical systems.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Why do I highlight mechanical systems?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Well, mechanical systems have a lot of structure to them.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     They come out of f. equals ma, and they're almost always
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     second order systems.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So what does that mean?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     That means I'm going to use a little bit more notation.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     I'll be specific, and I'll say q is
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     going to be the position vector.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     q dot is going to be my velocity vector.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So my state vector that I wrote on the last equation
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     is going to be the accumulation of q and q dot.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     The position vector-- I mean the joint angles,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     if there's a slider.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It doesn't have to be an angle.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It could be a length of its prismatic joint or something
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     like this.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     These are the things that identify
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     the position of the robot in space,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     and its time derivative is in q dot.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     And then really, the dynamics of interest
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     here are how the-- dynamics of how the velocity of all this
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     is trivial in a second hour system.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     But what I care about is the second derivative here,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     how the accelerations of the system
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     happen as a function of q dot and u, right?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So this is just a slightly more specialized form
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     of what I wrote on the first slide.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     And actually, because we care about mechanical systems,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     we're going to zoom in even a little bit more,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     put even more structure in.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Let's go ahead and assume that u enters
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     in only a very particular way, OK?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So we're going to think about systems that have this form.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     These are the control affine systems.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     This is more specific than this.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It says that humans still enter in some general way,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     as sort of a catch-all, I could write anything inside my map f.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     But this says that u can only inject
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     the accelerations an affine way.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It's got a linear term, and potentially a constant term
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     with respect to u.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     We're going to justify that by looking at the way
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     the equations fall out of our mechanical systems
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     and seeing that it-- if torque is an input, for instance,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     the accelerations are always affine in the torque.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     And the structure's going to make our lives better.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     We're going to exploit it in many different algorithms
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     throughout the term.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It doesn't always exist.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Airfoils on quickly moving vehicles
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     might be a counter example, although you
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     can linearize them.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     But this is a structure that we're
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     going to try to exploit whenever possible.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Does that make sense?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     This is all just a more specific form of the x dot
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     equals f of xu.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So now let's make our definition here.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So using this second order system.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     A second order system like this is,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     I'm going to say, define fully actuated first,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     is fully actuated.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Hopefully you can maybe predict what I'm going to say.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     If f2, if this guy here, f2, q, q dot is full rank.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     What matters is that it's full row rank, right?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So what does that mean?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Well, let's be a little specific here.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So let's say I have n positions I'm
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     trying to control in the system.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     And I have the dimension of u is m.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     I have m inputs.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     n positions, things I'm trying to control.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     m inputs, control inputs.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     And so f of 2, since it's going to map u to q double dot,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     f of 2 as a vector, it has to live
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     in the-- it's a matrix, right?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     An n by m matrix.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     And I'd like for the rank of f2 to be
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     greater than or equal to n.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     That implies the system is fully actuated.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     We're going to see why in great detail.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     But first let's make sure that the algebra is clear, OK?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So the rank of this matrix here has got to be greater than
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     or equal to n.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Now a couple things to note.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     By giving this definition, really, I

                    <div>
                     want to be able to say that the system is
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     fully actuated in some state.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So the answer, is a system fully actuated or not?
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     You state dependent, potentially.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It could be that for some positions of the robot,
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     I'm fully actuated.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     In other positions of the robot, I'm not.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It could change, depending-- because f of 2
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     will change as a function of q and q dot.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     So it could lose rank sometimes.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     Now in most cases, I think every case

                    <div>
                     that we'll talk about in class, it's

                    <div>
                     going to turn out to be a global property of the system.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     But it could.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It depends on-- well, that's not true.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     We'll hit examples where it will be
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     sort of state dependent on a property of the system.
                    </div>

                     <br/>

                    <div>
                     It's a function of q and q dot.

                    <div>
                     And the obvious follow on here is
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     the system is under actuated.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                     We coined a word.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                     If the rank-- so that's 2, q, q dot.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     It's under actuated in that state if it's ranked efficient.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                     <br/>

                    <div>
                     So hopefully that sort of, just by the algebra, makes sense.

                    <div>
                     But why is that such a big deal?

                     There's two types of systems in the world, I guess.

                    <div>
                     There's linear systems, and there's nonlinear systems.

                     you'll be disappointed.

                    <div>
                     So these are categorically extremely different situations.

                     then you're in a good place in terms of control.

                    <div>
                     And if you can't, you've got to solve a harder problem.

                    <div>
                     So the big deal about the underactuated systems

                    <div>
                     is that you have to think about the non-linear [INAUDIBLE].

                    <div>
